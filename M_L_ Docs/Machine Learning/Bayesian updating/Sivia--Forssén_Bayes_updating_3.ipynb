    "<h3>1. For the data above we can see three different convidence interval dependent on the prior given. I think the best approach in this case is that the coin is likely fair, which reflects a trusting perspective. I will say that People would assume that coins are normal until they have a good reason for questioning, for example when they are aware of the place the coin came from.  Hence, we can wade through the information and only start to feel a little weirdly if something out of the ordinary shows up. It seems like we are walking on the dangling rope of trying to be cool and cautious at the same time: not jumping to conclusions too quickly.</h3>\n",
