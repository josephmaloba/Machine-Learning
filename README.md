Hello! Welcome to my machine learning portfolio. This folder contains my lab work from my college course covering machine learning. Namely you will find files that use datasets and ML libraries common to Python.
The code used in the assignment was originally found in several books that we used throughout the course. Here is the list of authors and the respective texts that the code herein derives from.

Deep Learning with Python, Second Edition, Francois Chollet
A Hands-on Introduction to Machine Learning, Chirag Shah
Machine Learning Refined: Foundations, Algorithms and Applications, Second Edition, Jeremy Watt, Reza Borham, Aggelos K. Katsaggelos
Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective, Second Edition, Stephen Marsland
